# Storage Analyzer v2.0 (PowerShell)

## ðŸ“š CompTIA A+ 220-1201 Objectives Covered:
- **3.4**: Compare and contrast storage devices
- **5.2**: Troubleshoot drive and RAID issues

---

## ðŸ§  Description

This PowerShell utility scans all physical storage devices and outputs key system information, including:

- Operating system info and architecture
- Media type (SSD/HDD)
- Bus type (NVMe, SATA, PCIe)
- Spindle speed (if applicable)
- Partition style (MBR vs GPT)
- Estimated form factor (2.5", 3.5", M.2)
- Health status and disk size
- Removable drives and optical drive detection
- RAID/Storage pool check (if supported)
- Random CompTIA A+ study facts
- Optional "Quiz Me" interactive mode

This project was designed to reinforce both technical scripting and CompTIA exam readiness by simulating real-world IT diagnostics *and* active recall of certification knowledge.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to detect and classify storage hardware using PowerShell
- How to interpret drive interface types, partition styles, and media health
- How to build a dual-purpose script that both simulates real IT support tasks and supports active A+ certification study
