## 🔧 Features

- ✅ **Auto-detects CPU and GPU** to estimate power consumption
- ✅ **Distinguishes between laptops and desktops** for accurate wattage scaling
- ✅ **Estimates power draw** and recommends a PSU wattage with 30% headroom
- ✅ **Suggests 80+ efficiency rating** based on total draw
- ✅ **Determines modularity needs** (desktop only)
- ✅ **Outputs VAC compatibility** based on regional input (US / EU / Other)
